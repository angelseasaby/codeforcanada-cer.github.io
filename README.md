# National Energy Board - User recruitment

<a href="https://www.codefor.ca">Code for Canada</a>, in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.neb-one.gc.ca">National Energy Board</a>, are looking for participants external to this organization to participate in a series of workshops. These workshops will explore uses of a regulatory documents database, REGDOCS, and will take approximately 1 hour. Workshops will be conducted remotely and in person based on needs. We are also seeking participants to test prototypes.

These studies will guide the product direction for increasing accessibility, discoverability, and participation within a publicly available database.

For more information on REGDOCS, please visit <a href="https://apps.neb-one.gc.ca/REGDOCS/"> the regulatory database</a>.

Code for Canada is a national non-profit that connects government innovators with the tech and design community. Our programs enable governments to deliver better digital public services and empower communities to solve civic challenges using technology and design.
